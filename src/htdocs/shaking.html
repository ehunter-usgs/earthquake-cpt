    <td colspan="2">The cone, when it includes a seismometer, can also be used
      to predict how local shallow soil conditions can modify shaking. The capacity
      of local soil conditions to modify shaking is inversely proportional to
      the velocity of seismic waves near the surface, which can be computed with
      data recorded with the seismometer. Seismic energy is created manually with
      a sledgehammer or automatically by a compressed air driven hammer. We measure
      the time it takes for the seismic energy to travel from the land surface,
      through the ground, to a seismometer mounted in the cone. The distance to
      the seismometer divided by the travel time is approximately the average
      shear-wave velocity.</td>
